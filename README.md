# Computer_Vision_Practice

This repository is dedicated to learning skills for creating computer vision models using keras.

The models in this repository use an image dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) consisting of 21,400 images of 50% cats and 50% dogs.

I also followed the instruction provided by [DeepLizard](https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU) in their Machine Learning & Deep Learning Fundamentals tutorial.
